The reed-solomon-erasure-coding.jar file contains three pre-compiled .class
files. They are ReedSolomon.class, Galois.class, and Matrix.class. These class
files are located in a folder called 'erasure', which becomes visible when the
jar file is extracted using 'jar xf reed-solomon-erasure-coding.jar'. The 
build.gradle file was modified to compile jar files found in the lib folder,
which is where this jar has been moved. The package that this compilation 
creates is 'erasure', so to import the ReedSolomon class file for use in other
java files in the project, 'import erasure.ReedSolomon' must be added to the
top of every java file that will use the ReedSolomon class. ReedSolomon.class
itself imports the necessary files from Matrix.class and Galois.class, so
importing those is superfluous if ReedSolomon is the only class you'll be
accessing.
